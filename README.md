The Yeti Java OpenGL Engine
===========================

Summary
-------

This project is a personal project of mine, so it's not really recommended for 
serious projects. I try to document it decently, so one might learn one or two things
from it. Or at learn about what nasty hacks to avoid in the future.

Looking forward to any fork! :)

Running the thing
-----------------
The project isn't very hard to build. I've left the .classpath file generated by
Eclipse in, and as you can see, it requires, by default, three libraries. The 
easiest way to get it to run is to download jogl and unzip it in a lib/ folder
that's a sibling of the res/ and src/ ones.

You can get the latest JOGL here: http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z

The required JARs are: gluegen-rt.jar and jogl-all.jar.
